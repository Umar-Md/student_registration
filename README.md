# student_registration
This project is a React-based web application for managing student information using a form. The form allows users to input various student details, such as personal information, contact information, education details, and address, and stores the data using Redux for state management. The form includes validation for each field and displays relevant error messages when fields are left empty.

- **Bootstrap** and **Material UI** for styling.
- **Form Validation** on submit with error messages.
